#MuteShift
MuteShift is a powerful video editing tool designed to help you automatically mute or cut sections of a video containing music, with a focus on speed and lossless processing. This tool provides an intuitive preview interface, similar to professional video editors like Adobe Premiere, and highlights the parts of the video that contain music. Whether you're working with a movie, vlog, or any video that needs audio modifications, MuteShift makes it easy to mute or cut out audio segments quickly without compromising the video quality.

Features
Automatic Music Detection: MuteShift automatically identifies parts of the video containing music, allowing you to easily mute or remove the audio.
Lossless Editing: Using advanced processing techniques, MuteShift edits video without re-encoding, ensuring the highest quality and fastest rendering times.
Preview Mode: Preview your video in real-time, with music segments highlighted for easy identification.
Non-Destructive Editing: Your video’s original quality is preserved by avoiding re-encoding unless absolutely necessary.
Customizable Workflow: Modify music segments, mute them, or cut them entirely with simple controls, all in a streamlined interface.
